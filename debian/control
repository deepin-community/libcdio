Package: libcdio-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libcdio19 (= ${binary:Version}), ${libcdev}, libcam-dev [kfreebsd-any], ${misc:Depends}
Description: library to read and control CD-ROM (development files)
 This package contains development files (headers and static library)
 for the libcdio library.
 .
 This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and
 control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
 device-dependant properties of a CD-ROM can use this library.
 .
 Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available,
 so applications that use this library also have the ability to read
 disc images as though they were CD's.
